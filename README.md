I have created a folder named microservices, which contains several subfolders: client, analytics, payment, email, order, and kafka. The client folder contains the frontend application built with Next.js. Each of the other folders—analytics, payment, email, and order—represents a separate microservice and includes an index.js file that handles Kafka producer and consumer logic. The kafka folder contains the Kafka setup, including the admin.js file for topic configuration and a docker-compose.yml file to run Kafka, Zookeeper, and other related services. This structure allows for a modular and scalable microservices architecture with centralized Kafka messaging and a dedicated frontend.
